## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- Redux Toolkit (State Management)
- React Router (Routing)
- Tailwind CSS (Styling)
- Lucide React (Icons)
- Axios (HTTP Client)

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- Multer (File Upload)
- Nodemailer (Email Service)
- bcryptjs (Password Hashing)
- **Custom Compiler Service** (Child Process Execution)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- **System Compilers**: Python, GCC, Java JDK, PHP, Ruby, Go

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup

#### Backend Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/rbac-education

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production

# Email Configuration (Gmail)
MAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Frontend URL
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note**: For Gmail, you'll need to:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an App Password
3. Use the App Password in `MAIL_PASS`

#### Frontend Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### 4. Start MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:
```bash
mongod
```

### 5. Database Migration (IMPORTANT)
Before running the application for the first time, run the migration script to update existing users:

```bash
cd server
node migrate-users.js
```

This script will:
- Set `isFirstLogin: false` for all existing users
- Add audit fields (`createdBy`, `updatedBy`) to existing users
- Update password change history entries

### 6. Install System Compilers (For Code Compiler)
Ensure the following compilers are installed on your system:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 gcc g++ openjdk-11-jdk php ruby golang-go

# macOS
brew install python gcc java php ruby go

# Windows
# Install individual compilers from their official websites
```

### 7. Run the application

#### Backend
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Code Compiler**: http://localhost:5173/compiler

## New Features: First Login Password Change

### Overview
Students are now required to change their password on their first login. This enhances security by ensuring users don't continue using default or temporary passwords.

### How It Works
1. **New Students**: On first login, redirected to password change page
2. **Existing Students**: No password change required (after migration)
3. **Teachers/Admins**: Not affected by this feature
4. **One-Time Only**: Password change is only required once

### Testing the Feature
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
cd tests/api
node test_first_login.js
```

For detailed documentation, see [FIRST_LOGIN_PASSWORD_CHANGE.md](FIRST_LOGIN_PASSWORD_CHANGE.md)

## ðŸ§ª **Code Compiler Testing**

### Test the Compiler
```bash
# Test JavaScript execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/compiler/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"language":"javascript","code":"console.log(\"Hello World\")"}'

# Test Python execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/compiler/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"language":"python","code":"print(\"Hello World\")"}'

# Check compiler health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/compiler/health
```

# Auto-Submission Feature Implementation

## Overview

The auto-submission feature automatically submits draft task submissions when the deadline passes. This ensures that students don't lose their work due to missed deadlines and provides a fair system for task evaluation.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Submission**: Draft submissions are automatically converted to submitted status when the deadline passes
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple students and tasks simultaneously
- **Real-time Processing**: Runs every minute via cron job to ensure timely processing
- **Comprehensive Notifications**: Notifies both students and teachers about auto-submissions
- **Admin Management**: Full admin interface for monitoring and managing auto-submissions

### Key Components

#### Backend Components

1. **Auto-Submission Service** (`server/services/autoSubmissionService.js`)
   - Core business logic for processing auto-submissions
   - Batch processing of multiple tasks and students
   - Notification and email sending
   - Statistics and reporting

2. **Database Model Updates** (`server/models/Task.js`)
   - Added `isAutoSubmitted` and `autoSubmittedAt` fields to submission schema
   - Tracks auto-submission status and timestamp

3. **API Endpoints** (`server/routes/autoSubmission.js`)
   - `GET /api/auto-submission/stats` - Get auto-submission statistics
   - `POST /api/auto-submission/trigger` - Manually trigger auto-submission
   - `POST /api/auto-submission/trigger/:taskId` - Trigger for specific task
   - `GET /api/auto-submission/pending` - Get pending auto-submissions
   - `GET /api/auto-submission/history/:taskId` - Get auto-submission history

4. **Cron Job Scheduler** (`server/server.js`)
   - Runs every minute to check for tasks with passed deadlines
   - Processes auto-submissions automatically

#### Frontend Components

1. **Admin Auto-Submission Manager** (`client/src/components/admin/AutoSubmissionManager.jsx`)
   - View pending auto-submissions
   - Trigger auto-submissions manually
   - View statistics and history
   - Monitor system performance

2. **Student Interface Updates** (`client/src/components/student/StudentTaskDetail.jsx`)
   - Display auto-submission status
   - Show warning messages for auto-submitted tasks
   - Visual indicators for auto-submission

3. **Notification System Updates** (`client/src/components/common/NotificationPanel.jsx`)
   - Special styling for auto-submission notifications
   - Clear visual indicators for auto-submitted tasks

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes

```javascript
// Added to submission schema in Task.js
isAutoSubmitted: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
},
autoSubmittedAt: {
  type: Date
}
```

### Cron Job Configuration

```javascript
// Runs every minute
cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {
  const result = await autoSubmissionService.processAutoSubmissions();
  // Log results and handle errors
});
```

### Auto-Submission Process Flow

1. **Detection**: Cron job identifies tasks with passed deadlines that have draft submissions
2. **Processing**: For each task, all draft submissions are converted to submitted status
3. **Tracking**: Auto-submission flags and timestamps are set
4. **Notifications**: 
   - Teachers receive notifications about auto-submitted tasks
   - Students receive notifications about their auto-submitted work
   - Email notifications are sent to both parties
5. **Logging**: All actions are logged for audit purposes

### API Endpoints

#### Get Auto-Submission Statistics
```http
GET /api/auto-submission/stats
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalTasksWithAutoSubmissions": 5,
    "totalAutoSubmissions": 23,
    "tasksWithAutoSubmissions": [...]
  }
}
```

#### Trigger Auto-Submission
```http
POST /api/auto-submission/trigger
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Auto-submission process completed",
  "data": {
    "totalTasks": 3,
    "totalAutoSubmitted": 12,
    "results": [...]
  }
}
```

#### Get Pending Auto-Submissions
```http
GET /api/auto-submission/pending
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalTasks": 2,
    "totalDraftSubmissions": 8,
    "tasks": [...]
  }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables are required. The feature uses existing email configuration.

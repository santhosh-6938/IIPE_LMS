## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Database Schema
```javascript
// Attendance Model
{
  classroom: ObjectId,        // Reference to classroom
  date: Date,                // Attendance date
  records: [{
    student: ObjectId,       // Student reference
    status: String,          // 'present' or 'absent'
    markedBy: ObjectId,      // Teacher who marked attendance
    markedAt: Date,          // When attendance was marked
    notes: String            // Optional notes
  }],
  totalStudents: Number,     // Total students in class
  presentCount: Number,      // Number of present students
  absentCount: Number        // Number of absent students
}
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/attendance/classroom/:classroomId` - Get attendance for a specific date
- `PUT /api/attendance/classroom/:classroomId/student/:studentId` - Update student attendance

  pagination: {},              // Pagination information
  isLoading: false,            // Loading state
  error: null,                 // Error state
  successMessage: null         // Success messages
}

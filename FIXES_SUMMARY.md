# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Student Dashboard Task Count Not Updating

**Problem**: When a student submitted a task, the dashboard still showed completed tasks as 0 and pending tasks as 1.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `isTaskCompletedForUser` function had debug logging disabled
- The dashboard wasn't properly refreshing after task submission
- Event handling for task updates wasn't working correctly

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Debug Logging** (`client/src/store/slices/taskSlice.js`):
   - Re-enabled debug logging in `isTaskCompletedForUser` function to help track task completion status
   - Added console logs to track when tasks are updated after submission

2. **Improved Event Handling** (`client/src/store/slices/taskSlice.js`):
   - Added custom event dispatch in `submitTask.fulfilled` case
   - This ensures components are notified when tasks are submitted

3. **Better Dashboard Refresh** (`client/src/components/student/StudentDashboard.jsx`):
   - Improved event listener for task updates
   - Added console logging to track when refresh events are triggered
   - Reorganized useEffect hooks for better state management

### 2. Teacher Cannot Access Student Submission Files

**Problem**: Teachers were getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access student submission files.

**Root Cause**: 
- The file access route was too restrictive
- Teachers were trying to access files through submission-specific routes that required ownership checks
- The access control logic wasn't properly allowing teachers to access any submission file for tasks they own

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **Fixed Access Control** (`server/routes/tasks.js`):
   - Updated the submission file access route to properly allow teachers who own the task
   - Added clearer access control logic with better logging

2. **Added Direct File Access Route** (`server/routes/tasks.js`):
   - Created a new route `/tasks/files/:fileId/:action` for direct file access by teachers
   - This bypasses the submission-specific route and allows teachers to access any file by file ID
   - Added proper ownership verification for the task

3. **Updated Frontend File Access** (`client/src/components/teacher/TaskDetail.jsx`):
   - Modified `handlePreviewSubmissionFile` and `handleDownloadSubmissionFile` functions
   - Changed from using submission-specific routes to using the new direct file access route
   - This eliminates the 403 errors teachers were experiencing

## Technical Details

### File Access Routes

**Before**: 
```
GET /tasks/:taskId/submissions/:submissionId/files/:fileId/:action
```
- Required submission ownership check
- Teachers couldn't access files unless they owned the submission

**After**: 
```
GET /tasks/files/:fileId/:action (NEW)
GET /tasks/:taskId/submissions/:submissionId/files/:fileId/:action (IMPROVED)
```
- Direct file access for teachers by file ID
- Improved access control for submission-specific routes
- Teachers can now access any file for tasks they own

### Task Completion Tracking

**Before**:
- Debug logging was disabled
- No custom events for task updates
- Dashboard refresh was unreliable

**After**:
- Debug logging enabled for development
- Custom `taskSubmitted` events dispatched on submission
- Improved dashboard refresh with better event handling
- Console logging for debugging task updates

## Testing

A test file `tests/api/test_fixes.js` has been created to verify both fixes work correctly. The test:

1. Logs in as both teacher and student
2. Creates/uses a classroom and task
3. Submits a task as a student
4. Verifies task completion tracking
5. Tests teacher file access to submission files

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Student Dashboard Fix**:
   - Login as a student
   - Submit a task
   - Check that the dashboard shows the task as completed
   - Verify the completed tasks count increases

2. **Teacher File Access Fix**:
   - Login as a teacher
   - Navigate to a task with student submissions
   - Try to preview or download submission files
   - Verify no 403 errors occur

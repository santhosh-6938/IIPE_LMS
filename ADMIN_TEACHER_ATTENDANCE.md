## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

#### Database Schema
```javascript
// TeacherAttendance Model
{
  date: Date,                // Attendance date
  records: [{
    teacher: ObjectId,       // Teacher reference
    status: String,          // 'present' or 'absent'
    markedBy: ObjectId,      // Admin who marked attendance
    markedAt: Date,          // When attendance was marked
    notes: String            // Optional notes
  }],
  totalTeachers: Number,     // Total teachers in system
  presentCount: Number,      // Number of present teachers
  absentCount: Number        // Number of absent teachers
}
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/teacher-attendance/date/:date` - Get teacher attendance for a specific date
- `PUT /api/admin/teacher-attendance/teacher/:teacherId` - Update teacher attendance

### Frontend Components

#### Admin Components
1. **TeacherAttendanceManager** - Main teacher attendance management interface
   - Daily teacher attendance taking
   - Teacher attendance history viewing

### Redux State Management

#### Admin Teacher Attendance Slice
```javascript
{
  currentAttendance: null,      // Current day's teacher attendance
  attendanceHistory: [],        // Historical teacher attendance data
  teacherSummary: null,         // Individual teacher attendance summary
  statistics: null,             // Teacher attendance statistics
  dailyData: [],               // Daily attendance data for charts
  pagination: {},              // Pagination information
  isLoading: false,            // Loading state
  error: null,                 // Error state
  successMessage: null         // Success messages
}
```

3. If not, creates new record with all teachers marked as present
4. Admin can modify individual teacher statuses
5. Changes are saved to database

### Teacher Attendance Updates
1. Admin clicks present/absent button for a teacher
2. System updates the attendance record
3. Attendance counts are recalculated
4. Updated data is saved and reflected in UI

### Report Generation
1. Admin selects date range for report
2. System queries teacher attendance data for the period
